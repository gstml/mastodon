I can't believe how effin' ugly Mustodon is.  
But since *the only valiant way to complain is to create*, here's my attempt to make Mastodon cool on the web.  

Vanilla CSS with a few bugs here and there (documented in the CSS). Maybe not everything is covered.  
Wanna help me squash those bugs and style what I've missed?

Apply using Stylebot or similar.
